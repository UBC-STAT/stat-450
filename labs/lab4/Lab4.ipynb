    "## Fast Food Chains in the USA\n",
    "\n",
    "With their cheap meals and convenient drive-thrus, fast food restaurants are a growing demand in many countries. Despite their questionable ingredients and nutritional value, most Americans count on fast food in their daily lives (they are often delicious and so hard to resist...). \n",

    "\n",
    ">  Fast food was originally created as a commercial strategy to accommodate the larger numbers of busy commuters, travelers and wage workers who often didn't have the time to sit down at a public house or diner and wait the normal way for their food to be cooked. By making speed of service the priority, this ensured that customers with strictly limited time (a commuter stopping to procure dinner to bring home to their family, for example, or an hourly laborer on a short lunch break) were not inconvenienced by waiting for their food to be cooked on-the-spot (as is expected from a traditional \"sit down\" restaurant). For those with no time to spare, fast food became a multi-billion dollar industry.\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, fast food is very popular and lots of businesses are investing in advertisement as well as new ideas to make their chain stand out in the sea of restaurants. In fact, a business wishing to buy a franchise location in an existing chain is hiring you as a consultant. They want to know the current market situation to set up a franchise in a state on the west coast of the United States (California, Oregon, or Washington) with few fast food restaurants. Particularly, they would like to set up a franchise that is consistently popular on the west coast, but in a state which has few fast food restaurants.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you will pretend to assist in the opening of this new restaurant. Your goal is to figure out which chain to recommend and which state would be the least competitive (as measured by having fewer fast food restaurants). In order to do this, you will have to answer three questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Which is the most prevalent franchise on the west coast of the US? \n",
    "\n",
    "2) Is the most prevalent franchise consistent across the west coast?\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Which state on the west coast has the smallest number of fast food restaurants?\n",
    "\n",
    "You will answer these questions on the Lab 4 assignment on Canvas.\n",
    "Then, you will use the answers to provide a final recommendation to the clients."
