### R resources

Although this course is not about R, it is heavily based on R.
Here we point to some R resources that can be helpful to you in this course.

### Books

#### R for Data Science

This book was written by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund. It is a great book, which we highly
recommend you to read cover to cover and, most importantly, do the exercises. However, for this course
the following chapters are more relevant:

- [Chapter 3](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html);
- [Chapter 5](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html);
- [Chapters 10 to 13](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/tibbles.html);
- [Chapters 27 to 30](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/r-markdown.html);

#### Data Science: A First Introduction

This is the textbook of DSCI 100, and it was written by Prof. Tiffany Timbers, Prof. Trevor Campbell, and Prof. Melissa Lee. For this course, you might want to refresh the following chapters:

- [Chapter 3 - Cleaning and wrangling data](https://ubc-dsci.github.io/introduction-to-datascience/wrangling.html);
- [Chapter 4 - Effective data visualization](https://ubc-dsci.github.io/introduction-to-datascience/viz.html)
