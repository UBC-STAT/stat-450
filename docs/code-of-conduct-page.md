## Code of conduct
For STAT 450, we are committed to creating a friendly, respectful,
and supportive place for all people, no exceptions. As such, we do
not tolerate behaviour that is disrespectful to our teachers or learners
or that excludes, intimidates, or causes discomfort to others. We
do not tolerate discrimination or harassment. All participants in our
course are expected to show respect and courtesy to others. Everyone
participating in STAT 450 activities is required to conform to this Code of Conduct.


This Code of Conduct applies to all spaces managed by STAT 450 including,
but not limited to, class meetings, email communication,
and online forums such as Piazza and GitHub.
The STAT 450 teaching team are expected to assist with the enforcement
of the Code of Conduct, and all reports will be kept confidential.


### Expected Behavior

All participants in our events and communications are expected to show
respect and courtesy to others. All interactions should be professional
regardless of platform: either online or in-person. In order to foster
a positive and professional learning environment we encourage the following
kinds of behaviours in all STAT 450 events and platforms:
- Use welcoming and inclusive language
- Be respectful of different viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accept constructive criticism
- Focus on what is best for the community
- Show courtesy and respect towards other community members

Note: See the four social rules for further recommendations.

### Unacceptable Behavior

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants at any STAT 450 event/platform include:
- written or verbal comments which have the effect of excluding people
        on the basis of membership of any specific group
- causing someone to fear for their safety, such as through stalking,
        following, or intimidation
- violent threats or language directed against another person
- the display of sexual or violent images
- unwelcome sexual attention
- nonconsensual or unwelcome physical contact
- sustained disruption of talks, events or communications
- insults or put downs
- sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, or exclusionary jokes
- excessive swearing
- incitement to violence, suicide, or self-harm
- continuing to initiate interaction (including photography or recording)
        with someone after being asked to stop publication of private
        communication without consent

### Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

Participants who are asked to stop any inappropriate behavior are expected to
comply immediately. This applies to any STAT 450 events and platforms, either
online or in-person. If a participant engages in behavior that violates this
code of conduct, the teaching team may warn the offender and or engage the
STAT 450 Instructor to investigate the Code of Conduct violation and impose
appropriate sanctions.

### Incident Reporting Guidelines

If someone violates the Code of Conduct during a STAT 450 event or in an online
space outside of organised events, we ask that you report it to the instructor.
