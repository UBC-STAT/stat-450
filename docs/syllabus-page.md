## Syllabus
#### Winter Session 2023/24 Term 2

### Time and Place

- Lectures: Wed/Fri 9:00 am - 10:30 am in ESB 4192
- Labs: Fridays 3:00 pm - 4:00 pm in EOS 135


### Course Description 
This course provides the basic statistical toolkit required for the understanding and use of a range of methods for both summarizing and analyzing data, giving a platform for further study of applied Statistics. The emphasis in the course will be the application of these methods to real-life situations from Science.
 
### Course Objective
To train students to apply their statistical knowledge to applied research problems, to develop skills of working with non-statisticians either as a consultant or as a collaborator, and to communicate effectively, both orally and in writing, with statisticians and non-statisticians. 

Most course activities will be organized around a series of case studies based on recent and current applied research problems from different subject-areas. Students will participate in: 

- formulation of statistical approaches to these applied research problems,
- written and oral presentations of proposed statistical approaches,
- data exploration, model building and statistical inference,
- written and oral presentations of results of analyses,
- critical and interactive discussion of all aspects of the case study.
- Methodological topics that arise in the case studies will be discussed as necessary. 

Students will work individually and in groups in different class activities and assignments. Throughout the term, students will work in groups on real case studies. Each team will be supervised and supported by the teaching team. Each student will make oral presentations of their team’s work throughout the term and the teams will submit written reports of their work.  The grande finale is a semi-public poster session, at the end of the semester.  Note:  each team will need to split the costs of poster printing. 

### Prerequisites

STAT 306. Restricted to 4th year Statistics majors.

If you anticipate having trouble meeting a deadline and need an [academic concession](https://students.ubc.ca/enrolment/academic-learning-resources/academic-concessions), please reach out in advance via email to the instructors. [Here](https://stat540-ubc.github.io/course-admin/concession_template.pdf) is a template you can use for a self-declaration.

If you miss class, we suggest you to:

- Consult the class resources on Canvas
- Use the class Slack workspace to discuss missed material with classmates
- Visit office hours
- Seek academic concessions, if applicable

#### Academic Integrity

All students are expected to follow UBC's [Academic Honesty and Standards](http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=3,286,0,0#15620) policy. We encourage students to work together on assignments and labs, however all of your work must be written in your own words. Students must correctly cite references if you quote or use outside sources in your work, including any AI tools. Breach of the academic integrity policy may, at a minimum, result in a grade of 0 on the relevant assessment or may result in more serious consequences.

Please see UBC's Academic Calendar for detailed policies on [Academic Misconduct](http://calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=3,54,111,0).

#### Health and Safety

Please follow the current [UBC COVID-19 Campus Rules](https://srs.ubc.ca/covid-19/ubc-campus-rules-guidance-documents/) regarding self-monitoring, and staying home if you are sick. Although masks are no longer required on campus, please respect the choices of your fellow students and the instructional team who may continue to wear masks. 

We, the instructors, will do our best to stay well, but if we are ill, we will not come to class. If that happens, here’s what you can expect:
- Another instructor will substitute.
- Class may take place over Zoom (in this case, Zoom link will be posted on Canvas). 

#### Extreme Environmental Conditions Contingency Plan

In-person, on campus activities may need to be cancelled due to issues such as weather conditions (e.g., snow). The most up-to-date information about cancellations will be posted on [ubc.ca](https://www.ubc.ca/). Please check [ubc.ca](https://www.ubc.ca/) often during times when an extreme weather event could disrupt our course activities. Here is what you can expect in the event an in-person lecture or lab session is cancelled:

Depending on the nature of the planned in-class activities, class may take place over Zoom (in this case, Zoom link will be posted on Canvas), or an alternate activity may be posted on Canvas for you to complete before the next scheduled class. We will communicate over Slack to announce the specifics for each case that arises as soon as we can.
