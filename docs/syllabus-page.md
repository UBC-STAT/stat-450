### Course Policies

#### Academic Integrity 
All students are expected to follow UBC's [Academic Honesty and Standards](http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=3,286,0,0#15620) policy. We encourage students to work together on assignments and labs, however all of your work must be written in your own words. Students must correctly cite references if you quote or use outside sources in your work. Breach of the academic integrity policy may, at a minimum, result in a grade of 0 on the relevant assessment or may result in more serious consequences. 

Please see UBC's Academic Calendar for detailed policies on Academic Misconduct: http://calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=3,54,111,0.

### Covid Safety in the Classroom 
**Masks**: Masks are required for all indoor classes, as per the BC Public Health Officer orders. For the in-person meetings in this class, it is important that all of us feel as comfortable as possible engaging in class activities while sharing an indoor space.  For the purposes of this order, the term “masks” refers to medical and non-medical masks that cover our noses and mouths.  Masks are a primary tool to make it harder for Covid-19 to find a new host.  You will need to wear a medical or non-medical mask for the duration of our class meetings, for your own protection, and the safety and comfort of everyone else in the class.  You may be asked to remove your mask briefly for an ID check for an exam, but otherwise, your mask should cover your nose and mouth. Please do not eat in class. If you need to drink water/coffee/tea/etc, please keep your mask on between sips. Please note that there are some people who cannot wear a mask. These individuals are equally welcome in our class. 

**Vaccination**: If you have not yet had a chance to get vaccinated against Covid-19, vaccines are available to you, free, and on campus [http://www.vch.ca/covid-19/covid-19-vaccine]. The higher the rate of vaccination in our community overall, the lower the chance of spreading this virus.  You are an important part of the UBC community. Please arrange to get vaccinated if you have not already done so. 

**Seating in class**: To reduce the risk of Covid transmission, please sit in a consistent area of the classroom each day.  This will minimize your contacts and will still allow for the pedagogical methods planned for this class to help your learning.

#### Your personal health
If you’re sick, it’s important that you stay home – no matter what you think you may be sick with (e.g., cold, flu, other).  
A daily self-health assessment is required before attending campus. Every day, before coming to class, complete the self-assessment for Covid symptoms using this tool: https://bc.thrive.health/covid19/en 
Do not come to class if you have Covid symptoms, have recently tested positive for Covid, or are required to quarantine. You can check this website to find out if you should self-isolate or self-monitor: http://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/covid-19/self-isolation#Who. 
Your precautions will help reduce risk and keep everyone safer.  In this class, the marking scheme is intended to provide flexibility so that you can prioritize your health and still be able to succeed: 
- Clicker questions in lectures will not be for marks 
- We will automatically drop your lowest Webwork score and your lowest lab score, so it’s OK to occasionally miss an assignment (though it will help you on exams to complete them all, even for practice). 

**If you do miss class because of illness:** 
- Make a connection early in the term to another student or a group of students in the class.  You can help each other by sharing notes.  If you don’t yet know anyone in the class, post on the discussion forum to connect with other students. 
- Consult the class resources on Canvas.  We will post slides and section 101's recordings for each class.  
- Use the online discussion forum for help.  
- Go to virtual labs or instructor office hours to ask questions
- If you are concerned that you will need to miss a particular key activity due to illness, contact us to discuss. 

#### Instructor health

**If your instructor is sick:** I will do my best to stay well, but if I am ill, develop Covid symptoms, or test positive for Covid, then I will not come to class.  If that happens, you can expect one of the following:
- The other section's instructor will substitute 
- If I am well enough to teach, but am taking precautions to avoid infecting others, we may have a synchronous online session or two.  If this happens, you will receive an announcement in Canvas telling you how to join the class.  You can anticipate that this would very likely be a last minute message.  Our classroom will still be available for you to sit and attend an online session, in this (hopefully rare) instance.  
- You may receive a message from me with a recording of the lecture material for you to watch on your own time.
