### Course Description 
This course provides the basic statistical toolkit required for the understanding and use of a range of methods for both summarizing and analyzing data, giving a platform for further study of applied Statistics. The emphasis in the course will be the application of these methods to real-life situations from Science.
 
### Course Objective
To train students to apply their statistical knowledge to applied research problems, to develop skills of working with non-statisticians either as a consultant or as a collaborator, and to communicate effectively, both orally and in writing, with statisticians and non-statisticians. 

Most course activities will be organized around a series of case studies based on recent and current applied research problems from different subject-areas. Students will participate in: 

- formulation of statistical approaches to these applied research problems,
- written and oral presentations of proposed statistical approaches,
- data exploration, model building and statistical inference,
- written and oral presentations of results of analyses,
- critical and interactive discussion of all aspects of the case study.
- Methodological topics that arise in the case studies will be discussed as necessary. 

Students will work individually and in groups in different class activities and assignments. Throughout the term, students will work in groups on real case studies. Each team will be supervised and supported by the teaching team. Each student will make oral presentations of their team’s work throughout the term and the teams will submit written reports of their work.  The grande finale is a semi-public poster session, at the end of the semester.  Note:  each team will need to split the costs of poster printing. 

### Prerequisites

STAT 306. Restricted to 4th year Statistics majors.

We encourage students to work together on assignments and labs, however all of your work must be written in your own words. Students must correctly cite references if you quote or use outside sources in your work. Breach of the academic integrity policy may, at a minimum, result in a grade of 0 on the relevant assessment or may result in more serious consequences.
