### Course Policies

#### Academic Integrity

All students are expected to follow UBC's [Academic Honesty and Standards](http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=3,286,0,0#15620) policy. We encourage students to work together on assignments and labs, however all of your work must be written in your own words. Students must correctly cite references if you quote or use outside sources in your work. Breach of the academic integrity policy may, at a minimum, result in a grade of 0 on the relevant assessment or may result in more serious consequences.

Please see UBC's Academic Calendar for detailed policies on Academic Misconduct: http://calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=3,54,111,0.

### Classroom Instructions

For our in-person meetings in this class, it is important that all of us feel as comfortable as possible engaging in class activities while sharing an indoor space. 

- **Masks:** Masks **are required** for all for all indoor public spaces on campus, including classrooms, as per the BC Public Health Officer orders. Mask wearing protects you as well as others in your environment. **Let’s do everything we can as a community to stop the spread of this virus**.

- You will need to wear a medical or non-medical mask for the duration of our class meetings, for your own protection, and the safety and comfort of everyone else in the class.
- For the purposes of this order, the term “masks” refers to medical and non-medical masks that cover our noses and mouths.  Masks are a primary tool to make it harder for Covid-19 to find a new host.
- You may be asked to remove your mask briefly for an ID check for an exam, but otherwise, your mask should cover your nose and mouth. Please <em>do not eat in class</em>. If you need to drink water/coffee/tea/etc, please keep your mask on between sips. 

- Students who need to request an exemption to the indoor mask mandate must do so based on one of the grounds for exemption detailed in the [PHO Order on Face Coverings (COVID-19)](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/health/about-bc-s-health-care-system/office-of-the-provincial-health-officer/covid-19/covid-19-pho-order-face-coverings.pdf). Such requests must be made through the [Center for Accessibility](info.accessibility@ubc.ca). Students who cannot wear masks are equally welcome in our class.

- **Vaccination:** If you have not yet had a chance to get vaccinated against Covid-19, vaccines are available to you, free, and on campus: visit [https://planning.ubc.ca/news/how-get-covid-19-vaccine-clinic-ubc](https://planning.ubc.ca/news/how-get-covid-19-vaccine-clinic-ubc) and [http://www.vch.ca/covid-19/covid-19-vaccine](http://www.vch.ca/covid-19/covid-19-vaccine) for more information.
  - The higher the rate of vaccination in our community overall, the lower the chance of spreading this virus.  You are an important part of the UBC community. Please arrange to get vaccinated if you have not already done so.

- **Seating in class:** To reduce the risk of Covid transmission, please sit in a consistent area of the classroom each day.  This will minimize your contacts and will still allow for the pedagogical methods planned for this class to help your learning.  

### Your personal health

If you’re sick, it’s important that you stay home – no matter what you think you may be sick with (e.g., cold, flu, other).

- A daily self-health assessment is required before attending campus. Every day, before coming to class, complete the self-assessment for Covid symptoms using this tool: [https://bc.thrive.health/covid19/en](https://bc.thrive.health/covid19/en)
- Do not come to class if you have Covid symptoms, have recently tested positive for Covid, or are required to quarantine. You can check this website to find out if you should self-isolate or self-monitor: [http://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/covid-19/self-isolation#Who](http://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/covid-19/self-isolation#Who).
- Your precautions will help reduce risk and keep everyone safer.  In this class, the marking scheme is intended to provide flexibility so that you can prioritize your health and still be able to succeed. Please contact the instructors at [stat450@stat.ubc.ca](mailto:stat450@stat.ubc.ca) if you have any concerns or need special arrangements.

#### Missing lecture(s) because of illness:

If you’re sick, it’s important that you **stay home**. Do not come to class. In such case, we suggest you to:

- Make a connection early in the term to another student or a group of students in the class. You can help each other by sharing notes.
- Check Canvas regularly. We will post all the resources there.  
- Use the Piazza online discussion forum for help.
- Come to virtual office hours.
- If you are concerned that you will need to miss a particular key activity due to illness, contact us to discuss.

For additional information about academic concessions, see the UBC policy here: [http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=3,329,0,0](http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=3,329,0,0).

### Instructor health

We, the instructors, will do our best to stay well, but if we are ill, we will not come to class. If that happens, here’s what you can expect:

- Another instructor will substitute.
- If we are well enough to teach but are taking precautions to avoid infecting others, we will have a synchronous online session. If this happens, you will receive an email and an announcement in Canvas telling you how to join the class.  You can anticipate that this would very likely be a last-minute email.  Our classroom will still be available for you to sit and attend an online session in this (hopefully rare) instance.
