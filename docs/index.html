        <h2>Course information</h2>

        <p>In this capstone course, students have the opportunity to work on projects from external partners, analyzing
            their data to answer their research questions. Thus, in this course, students will not only tie together the
            skills learned in previous statistics courses, but will also learn additional analysis and visualization
            methods, all in the context of modern computing that supports team work and a reproducible, responsible work
            flow. Students will also have the opportunity to develop the skills necessary to communicate their data
            analyses to their classmates and to non-statisticians.</p>

        <p>The course begins with examples of case studies and work that ensures students are comfortable with
            environments such as Slack and GitHub. Students will also advance their skills in R. For the rest of the
            semester, students will work in teams, each with a specific external partner. The work will be discussed not
            only with the external partners, but also with the class as a whole. The work will be supported by the STAT
            450 teaching team. Students will present their work as a written report and also in a poster session on the
            last day of class. You can see the <a
                href="https://www.stat.ubc.ca/poster-session-stat-450-stat-550">2018</a> and <a
                href="https://www.stat.ubc.ca/poster-session-stat-450-stat-550-0">2019</a> poster session information to
            see what sorts of things students have worked on (the collaborators are the external partners). Sadly,
            because of COVID, STAT 450 was not offered in 2020-21. We are excited to be back on track with this course.
            However, this year, we will not be pairing STAT 450 with STAT 550.</p>

        <h3>Meetings and course structure</h3>
        <p>The class has 3 times listed as lectures (Mon, Wed, Fri, 9-10) and 1 time listed as a lab (Fri 3-4). Students
            must register in and attend both, the lectures and the labs.</p>

        <p>Please note that the structure of this course is different from other statistics courses. Students do not
            work
            on data sets from textbooks or the web, but rather on real world projects submitted by external partners.
            Therefore student learning will be focused on the problems that arise from the projects, with the teaching
            team
            providing guidance to the students. Some of the instruction may have a more classical format if the topics
            are
            beneficial to most of the class’s projects.</p>


        <h3>Who can take this course?</h3>
        <p>Although this course is officially restricted to 4th year students in a Statistics program, students in other
            programs can take this course, with permission of the teaching team. Students should feel comfortable using
            R,
            at least at a basic level, and should have taken STAT 306. Other third year level statistics courses would
            be
            beneficial. Please do contact us if you are interested in the course but aren’t in a Statistics program (at
            <a href="mailto:stat450@stat.ubc.ca">stat450@stat.ubc.ca)</a>.
